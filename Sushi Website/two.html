          This restaurant has some of the best sushi I've ever had, at a good value price. They typically serve all of their sushi in matte black boxes that have soy sauce, wasabi and ginger that come with them. The interior of the restuarant is nicely decorated and well-lit and the staff is very responsive and caring. One specific sushi roll I would recommend from their menu are the Tataki Maki roll which has seared tuna, yellowtail, avocado, tempura, jalape&ntilde;o, steak spice, tobiko, sesame oil and sesame seeds. It also comes with spicy mayo or hot sauce. If you like spicy food, I would encourage you to give it a try.

            This restaurant has a huge variety of different sushi to try, which is all the more reason to go there because they offer all-you-can-eat lunch and dinner rates. Going there with a large group of friends or family is a great way to get value out of the experience and to experiment with different types of sushi to find the ones that you like the most. There arenâ€™t any specific sushi rolls I would recommend, but I will say that trying many different types and being open minded about which ones to try can introduce you to a world of flavours that you never knew existed before.

          I really enjoy the spicy mayonnaise on top of the sushi, and the variety of ingredients overall. I would rank these as my number 1 because they were one of the first few sushi rolls that I tried and immediately fell in love with. If you don't mind a little bit of spiciness in your sushi, I would highly recommend these at almost any restaurant out there.

        <h3><li>Shrimp Tempura Roll</li></h3>

          Another one of my favourites, the gap between how much I like these and the number one rank is not that big. I would recommend these if you don't enjoy eating raw fish in sushi, and if you really like shrimp. The shrimps inside of the sushi are very crispy which is a great contrasting texture to the soft rice on the outside. Overall, they serve as an amazing introduction to the world of sushi.

        <h3><li>Philadelphia Roll</li></h3>

          This one was very surprising when I first tried it. If you love cream cheese, these are an amazing western-style sushi that could also serve as an introduction to sushi. If you dislike uncooked fish, then these are great because the smoked salmon flavour is very apparent among all of the other ingredients in the sushi. It complements the cream cheese texture and flavour very well.
