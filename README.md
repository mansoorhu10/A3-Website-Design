# A3-Website-Design

This is Assignment 3 from my Introduction to Website Design and Development course that I took in the Winter 2022 semester. It incorporates many components of HTML, CSS, and design fundamentals that I learned from the course readings. The prompt for this assignment was to create an HTML website with an external CSS style sheet that spans across at least three separate webpages and can cover any topic of choice. So, I decided to create a website about one of my favourite foods, sushi. You can view the website by downloading all of the contents of this repository, then viewing the home.html page in a web browser.
